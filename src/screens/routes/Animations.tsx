        During our continuous accessibility (mainly screen reader) effort in Reac Native, we bumped
        into an issue where focus would be lost for the screen reader when navigating to a new view
        in a stack using React Navigation.
      </Body>
      <Body>
        You would transition from the overview to a detail page, but instead o respecting the
        navigation tree for that page, react-navigation would fo the screen reader on the position
        your focus was in the previous sc This would pose a big problem of course: Imagine scrolling
        through g list (FlatList), then navigating to the detail for the item you tapped, and having
        the screen reader focus somewhere on the middle of the screen.
      </Body>
      <Body>
        This issue was however only happening on iOS.My guess was that react-navigation in some way
        does not respect the iOS native navigati elements and does some JS things inbetween, which
        makes iOS act up in this case.

      <Header>The fix</Header>
      <Body>
        To fix it, we created the useAccessibilityFocus hook!Itâ€™s very simple and will just return a
        ref to bind to your element, and a function to trigger focus to the element carrying the
        ref:
      </Body>
    </ScrollView>
  );
};

# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Mobile Accessibility! Please take a moment to review this document if you decide to contribute to the app.

There are only a few guidelines to contribute to this app:

- If relevant, open a discussion in the Github issues first
- The repo is set up to ease the development in Visual Studio Code (automatic formatting with Prettier etc.). If you use another editor, please make sure your code is also formatted with [Prettier](https://prettier.io).
- When adding a new screen, take a look at the previous examples and add your screen in `src/screens/routes/` and export it in `src/screens/routes/index.ts`. This will auto load it in the app.
